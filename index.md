## It's a horrible username, but what can you do?

#Growth mindset:

I work in an environment that has stripped the words "growth mindset" of any real meaning, so to strip the concept down and remove all trace of not-clarity, here are three brutally simple concepts to encapsulate it's essence:

- I can, for I must, therefore I will.
- Struggle creates skill.
-* *Why do we even like threes, anyway? Let's not take ourselves too seriously.

In the words of someone the internet does not remember:
> Tell me and I forget,
teach me and I remember,
involve me and I learn.
