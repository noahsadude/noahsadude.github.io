## It's a horrible username, but that's not the point.

Hello! I'm Noah. Pleasure to (virtually) meet you! I'm sure you'll catch something pithy from time to time from me, pay it no mind.

##### Growth Mindset

I work in an environment that has removed meaning from the words "growth mindset", so to strip the concept down and remove all trace of not-clarity, here are three brutally simple concepts to encapsulate it's essence:

- I can, for I must, therefore I will.
- Struggle creates skill.
*Why do we even like threes, anyway? Let's not take ourselves too seriously.

In the words of someone the internet does not remember:
> Tell me and I forget,
teach me and I remember,
involve me and I learn.
