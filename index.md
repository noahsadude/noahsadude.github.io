## It's a horrible username, but that's not the point.

Hello! I'm Noah. Pleasure to (virtually) meet you! I'm sure you'll catch something pithy from time to time from me, pay it no mind.

I began my path into programming fairly young, but always found it a little too daunting or just a little too much effort for not enough gain. That ends now.

I started at @codefellows partly out of the desire to really kick my ability to leverage myself into high gear, but also partly out of fear. I realized that with the advances in machine learning and AI in general, my job as an analyst is going to rapidly change ([an excellent discussion on this here](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-implications-marketing-analytics/)). 

*My goal is to transition away from the guy building the thing that gives the insights into the guy that builds the thing that builds the thing that gives the insights.

Also, I code to make it so that I don't have to math. Please don't make me math hard. It breaks.

##### The Growth Mindset

I work in an environment that has removed meaning from the words "growth mindset", so to strip the concept down and remove all trace of not-clarity, here are three brutally simple concepts to encapsulate it's essence:

- I can, for I must, therefore I will.
- Struggle creates skill.
- You are who you choose to be. So choose.

My answer:

- I will, for I can, therefore I must.
- Skill is useless without struggle.
- I... choose.

In the words of someone the internet does not remember:
> Tell me and I forget,
teach me and I remember,
involve me and I learn.
